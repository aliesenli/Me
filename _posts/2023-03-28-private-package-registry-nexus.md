When it comes to managing software dependencies, the Nexus Repository Manager is one of the most popular options available. This powerful tool allows you to store and distribute binary components across your organization, making it easier to build, test, and deploy software applications. However, if you're looking to host and run Nexus Repository Manager behind an Nginx reverse proxy, there are a few steps you'll need to follow. In this blog post, we'll guide you through the process.

## What is a Reverse Proxy?

Before we dive into the specifics of hosting Nexus Repository Manager behind Nginx, it's important to understand what a reverse proxy is. In simple terms, a reverse proxy is a server that sits between a client and a web server. When a client sends a request to a web server, the request first goes through the reverse proxy server. The reverse proxy server then sends the request to the web server and receives the response. The response is then sent back to the client.

Reverse proxies are commonly used for load balancing, caching, and security purposes. In the case of Nexus Repository Manager, we're interested in using Nginx as a reverse proxy for security purposes.

## Installing Nexus Repository Manager

The first step in hosting Nexus Repository Manager behind Nginx is to install Nexus Repository Manager. You can download the latest version of Nexus Repository Manager from the official website. Once you've downloaded the installation file, follow the installation instructions to complete the installation.

## Configuring Nginx Reverse Proxy

Next, we need to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for Nexus Repository Manager. To do this, we need to create an Nginx configuration file. Here's an example configuration file:

```javascript
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name nexus.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

```
